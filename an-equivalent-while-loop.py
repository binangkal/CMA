# using a while loop equivalent of a for loop

print('My name is')
i = 0 # variable is declared to be 0 
while i < 5: #programs loop to iterate until the value of I exceeds 5. In english, while means "as long as" 
    print('Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')') # counting is programmed by including the variable I 
    i = i + 1 # declares the value of to increase by 1 every iteration
